# E-Scape DICOM Interactive Escape Room

**Overview:**
E-Scape DICOM is an interactive escape room project that teaches the fundamentals of working with DICOM files. The project transforms traditional lectures into engaging puzzles where participants extract metadata, process images, and perform segmentation tasks using CT scan data.

**How It Works:**

- Room 1: Metadata Extraction – Retrieve key details (equipment model, study date, patient sex) from DICOM files.
- Room 2: Image Processing – Apply denoising techniques to reveal hidden numerical clues.
- Room 3: Image Segmentation – Use segmentation algorithms to isolate anatomical structures and calculate the DICE index.
Each room’s challenge generates a numeric code that unlocks the next stage.

**Setup:**

Open the provided Google Colab notebooks (links in this repository).
Follow the step-by-step instructions and use the supplied manuals for guidance.
Combine the codes from each room to “escape” and complete the challenge.
